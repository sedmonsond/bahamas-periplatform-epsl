README.txt for supplementary information dataset for Edmonsond et al. (submitted to EPSL): "Shallow carbonate geochemistry in the Bahamas since the last interglacial period"

Laboratory methods are described in the main text and supplementary material of Edmonsond et al. (in review). Supplementary data are provided in four Excel workbooks: 

______________________________________________________
core_metadata.xlsx

Latitude, longitude, water depth, and collection year for each sediment core. 

______________________________________________________

core_geochemistry_summary.xlsx

Summary of geochemical data (d13C, d18O, mineralogy, d44Ca, and elemental concentrations relative to Ca and Mg), radiocarbon ages, and MCMC age estimates for each sample. Data for each sediment core is provided in a separate sheet. 

______________________________________________________

clumped_isotope_data.xlsx 

Summary clumped isotope (D47) data are reported in the 'Clumped - Sample Averages' sheet, along with associated d13C and d18O data. Data for individual analyses of samples are in 'Clumped - Samples', while data for individual analyses of standards are in 'Clumped - Standards'. 

______________________________________________________
u-series_data.xlsx

U-series data and calculated U-Th ages for 4 periplatform core samples. 

______________________________________________________

banktop_mineralogy.xlsx

Summary of XRD mineralogy, d13C, and d18O data for shallow-water banktop sediments plotted in Figure 3B of the main text. The UTM coordinates for each sample also are provided. Mineralogy data for periplatform core samples is provided in core_geochemistry_summary.xlsx

d13C and d18O data for banktop sediments previously were published in: 
Geyman, E.C. & Maloof, A.C. 2021. Facies control on d13C on the Great Bahama Bank, Geology 49(9): 1049-1054, https://doi.org/10.1130/G48862.1.
