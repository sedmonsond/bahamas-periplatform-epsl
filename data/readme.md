Description of supplementary data for Edmonsond et al. (2024): "Shallow carbonate geochemistry in the Bahamas since the last interglacial period"

Laboratory methods are described in the main text and supplementary material of Edmonsond et al. (2024), available at `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2023.118566`. Supplementary data are provided in .csv files:

### core_metadata.csv

Latitude, longitude, water depth, and collection year for each sediment core. 

### core_geochemistry_summary

Summary geochemical data (d13C, d18O, mineralogy, d44/40Ca, and elemental concentrations relative to Ca and Mg), radiocarbon ages, and MCMC age estimates for each sample. Data for each sediment core is provided in a separate .csv file. 

### clumped_isotope_data

Summary clumped isotope (D47) data are reported in `sample_averages.csv`, along with associated d13C and d18O data. Data for individual analyses of samples are in `samples.csv`, while data for individual analyses of standards are in `standards.csv`. 

### u-series_data.xlsx

Excel file with U-series data and calculated U-Th ages for 4 periplatform core samples. 

### banktop_mineralogy.csv

Summary of XRD mineralogy, d13C, and d18O data for shallow-water banktop sediments plotted in Figure 3B of the main text. The UTM coordinates for each sample also are provided. Mineralogy data for periplatform core samples is provided in `core_geochemistry_summary`

d13C and d18O data for banktop sediments previously were published in: 
Geyman, E.C. & Maloof, A.C. 2021. Facies control on d13C on the Great Bahama Bank, Geology 49(9): 1049-1054, https://doi.org/10.1130/G48862.1.
